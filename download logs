Q:
-Explain what is the purpose of each file in this repo. How they related to each other. What do I do if I need to run this agent?
-Do I need an account with Arxiv.org for this system to work? NO. Arxiv API free.

Who else can access Flask web server for AgentRxiv apart from me?
-Currently, No one else but me.

I would like to upload to, read from and write to Flask web application AgentRXiv in txt files instead of pdf. How can I modify this repo to achieve that.
